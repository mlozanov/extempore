      This formula doesn't actually build from source, it just pulls down a
      precompiled tarball.  Extempore is now installed in #{prefix}

      You can link it to somewhere on your path if you like, but then remember to
      specify the libs/ directory in full in .xtm source files
      e.g. (load "#{prefix}/libs/foolib.xtm")
